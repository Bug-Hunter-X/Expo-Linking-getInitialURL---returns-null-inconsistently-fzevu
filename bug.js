This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is successfully opened, leading to unexpected behavior. This is particularly problematic in situations where the app is launched directly via a deep link, making it difficult to determine the initial route or perform actions based on the deep link parameters.
